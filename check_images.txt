Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, Alexnet classifier could not classify the dog's breed correctly in Dog_01 file, the picture was of a pug , but it classified it as a bull-mastiff, The other classifiers made the correct classification.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, Alexnet outputted the correct breed classification for Dog_02 file but not for Dog_01, Whereas the other classifiers had matching classifications for both files with correct outputs. Alexnet outputted the breed bull-mastif for Dog_01 and pug for Dog_02.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: No, all classifiers classified the Object_name_01 file correctly, but Animal_Name_01 files were shown to have different outputs for all the three classifiers, resnet outputted tiger-cat, vgg outputted tabby-cat and finally alexnet outputted leonberg. vgg and resnet have the best predictions so far.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Based on the results, I would suggest using vgg or resnet in image upload classification due to their accuracy and simplicity in implementation, but out of both of these two classifiers, In terms of time consumed for processing , I would like to  choose vgg, as it can provide accurate results with less processing time consumed in CPU and GPU compared to resnet.
